Real-Time News Search Engine

This a news search engine maintained by Chen-Wei Tsai. The goal is to build a real-time search engine which enables users to reach the latest news from different website easily.
Now the search engine crawls news from the New York Times since the New York Times provides APIs which would inform us there are new articles appearing in the New York Times' website.
