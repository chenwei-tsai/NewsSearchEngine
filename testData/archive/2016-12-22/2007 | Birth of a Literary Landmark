America\u2019s newest literary landmark is not a library, a bookstore, an author\u2019s birthplace or her salon. It is Room 05S1-228 on the fifth floor of The New York Times\u2019s headquarters near Times Square. A nondescript box of a space, closed off by a sliding frosted-glass door, the 5-by-9-foot room was originally intended as a refuge where employees could spend a few private moments crying or chilling. But since it faced the Book Review\u2019s cubicles, it became something else: a gallery of autographs from literary luminaries, written like graffiti with black markers on white plaster walls. E. L. Doctorow? He\u2019s on the west wall, hovering over Garrison Keillor. Gay Talese\u2019s signature practically rests on Mr. Doctorow\u2019s \u201cw,\u201d while Rafael Yglesias\u2019s autograph nearly bumps into Mr. Talese\u2019s \u201cG.\u201d Tessa Hadley? Present and accounted for, in an especially bold hand, a few inches below Francine Prose and above Augusten Burroughs, who finds himself near Jules Feiffer, Edmund White and Richard Price. That\u2019s Colson Whitehead and Charlotte Rogan in the upper left corner of the west wall, Jay McInerney and Rebecca Goldstein in the upper right. Round the corner to the south wall and you find a cluster of Christopher Buckley, Joe Klein and Martin Amis. Across the room are Norris Church Mailer, Richard Ford, Teddy Wayne, Geoff Dyer, Phillip Lopate, Anna Quindlen, Amy Waldman and Tom Perrotta; with John Banville taking the prize for calligraphic penmanship. Below their signatures, tucked into a corner at floor level and usually hidden by a pedestal table, is the most delightful calling card of all. The cartoonist and graphic novelist Chris Ware appears in a kind of snowman stick figure of three circles (four if you count his right ear). In 2007, when The Times left 229 West 43rd Street and settled into its current home, 620 Eighth Avenue, the critic Dwight Garner was the senior editor of The Book Review. \u201cWe\u2019d moved into the new building, which was beautiful but also a bit sterile, compared to the Book Review\u2019s chaotic and warren-like offices in the old building,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked art that\u2019s done directly on walls \u2014 Thurber\u2019s drawings at the old New Yorker building and the murals at the Bemelmans bar,\u201d Mr. Garner said. \u201cAsking writers to do this was in that tradition; a chance to warm the place up.\u201d \u201cSuddenly all these writers were coming in for the podcast \u2014 in the old days, visits from major authors were far more rare \u2014 and this seemed like a way to remember,\u201d he said. Sam Tanenhaus was the editor of The Book Review from 2004 to 2013. \u201cThe ritual was for me to take the guests to the signing room to add their autographs after I finished interviewing them on the podcast,\u201d Mr. Tanenhaus said. \u201cAll I remember is the ones who got away: Updike (because I didn\u2019t want to force him to make another stop), John Irving (because it slipped my mind).\u201d Mr. McInerney dropped by The Times for a podcast in 2009, when \u201cHow It Ended\u201d was being reviewed. The visit began in Mr. Tanenhaus\u2019s office, as Mr. McInerney remembered: \u201cHe said, \u2018Do you want to read the review?\u2019 and of course I did, and of course I was nervous, though I assumed he wouldn\u2019t have asked me if it wasn\u2019t a pretty good review. It was more than pretty good, and it was written by Sam himself, and it was the cover of The Book Review. So I was in an incredibly good mood when I signed my name on that wall.\u201d Mr. Keillor thought he might have been visiting The Times for a symposium on Op-Ed pages. \u201cI remember that because I ventured the opinion that the Op-Ed page should be limited to work that is actually written by the person who signs it, which would eliminate all the stuff by politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThis idea was scorned by the Times guy who was chairing the session.\u201d But Blake Wilson, who was then the web producer for The Book Review, said he remembered the occasion as a 2010 podcast on Mark Twain. In fact, Mr. Wilson said, he could scarcely forget the sight of Mr. Keillor\u2019s \u201cgreat lumbering frame getting down to make that tiny mark.\u201d Mr. Keillor\u2019s signature appears near the bottom of the west wall. Asked why he had gone to such trouble, he said, \u201cI suppose I signed it there so as to be down below the true luminaries and not above E. L. Doctorow.\u201d Even less conspicuous is Mr. Ware\u2019s corner-dwelling self-portrait, most likely made after he recorded a podcast in 2012, when \u201cBuilding Stories\u201d was published and reviewed. \u201cThat\u2019s the last time I was in the offices, though I don\u2019t really recall committing the act of vandalism itself,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I going to be sued? If so, I heartily deny everything.\u201d Mr. Ware is safe. His cartoon\u2019s fate is less certain. On Dec. 16, The Times announced that it would be vacating space above the 15th floor at 620 Eighth Avenue next year and changing the layout of the floors it continues to occupy. Benchlike desks will replace cubicles and private offices. Team meeting rooms and other common spaces will abound. But it is unclear what will happen to \u201ccrying rooms\u201d like 05S1-228. Presumably, its autographed walls could be conserved in place or salvaged for use elsewhere. A Times spokesman offered this assurance: \u201cWhile specific decisions like this one have not yet been made, we have every intention of preserving the historical artifacts that exist throughout our work space.\u201d Mr. Ware likes that idea. \u201cI\u2019d imagine that the literary signatures thereon beyond my own crass doodle are much more worthy of preserving/saving/whatevering,\u201d he said, \u201cso if you need a vote in favor toward bringing in a Sawzall and setting to work toward that end, you\u2019ve got mine.\u201d Mr. Keillor is not persuaded. \u201cI am all in favor of remodeling, and I vote for the wall to be painted over,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone here, with the exception of Ed Doctorow and Francine Prose and a couple others, will be forgotten 10 years from now anyway. The Times is a newspaper, not a museum.\u201d (Glad someone still thinks so.) The Book Review has since decamped to the fourth floor. The marketing department has taken its place on five. Nat Whitten, a freelance copywriter, adopted Room 05S1-228 as his own office a few years ago. He is gracious and generous about sharing it with people who stop by to gawk. And, yes, a few of his literary heroes are on the wall: Messrs. Ford, Perotta, Talese and Wayne among them. \u201cSometimes, when I\u2019m lonely,\u201d Mr. Whitten said, \u201cI envision them hanging out here.\u201d But not in judgment. \u201cI don\u2019t allow myself to get intimidated,\u201d Mr. Whitten said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to get writer\u2019s block just because Richard Price\u2019s signature is staring me in the back.\u201d","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/insider/2007-birth-of-a-literary-landmark.html"}
