Putin has ordered his government to more tightly restrict the production and sale of consumer products containing significant amounts of alcohol, after the deaths of 72 people in the Siberian city of Irkutsk who drank a product that purported to be scented bath lotion but was actually a cheap surrogate for liquor. The deaths shocked many Russians, evoking grim memories of widespread destitution after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Local officials said that 41 of the victims died at hospitals and 31 were found dead. Most had come from poor families or were homeless and seeking refuge from the bitter cold. Mr. Putin ordered the government to tighten regulations on products like perfumes, cleaning solutions, personal-care items and other consumer products that were more than 25 percent alcohol, and to impose harsher penalties for violations. Russian investigators have detained 13 people who are suspected of distributing the deadly liquid. It was packaged as \u201cbath lotion\u201d with a warning that it was not for internal consumption, but the label also said it contained 93 percent ethyl alcohol, the type found in liquor, wine and beer. In fact, it was made with methyl alcohol, which is poisonous. The investigators said they had discovered two workshops where the poisonous lotion was made. Mr. Putin\u2019s order also called for changes to be considered in how alcohol was taxed, \u201cwith the aim of reducing demand for fake alcohol,\u201d according to the Kremlin\u2019s website. Bottles of the mislabeled lotion were sold for about $1. Prices for a standard bottle of vodka, which contain twice as much liquid but whose contents are only about 40 percent alcohol, start at more than $3. Some lawmakers said they thought the country\u2019s liquor industry was exploiting the deaths in Irkutsk to get relief from taxes that were imposed in part to combat alcoholism. Gennady G. Onishchenko, a member of Parliament and former chief sanitary officer for the country, told the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda that \u201cthe alcohol lobby is bitterly against the anti-alcoholism concept, passed in 2009.\u201d The number of Russians who die from alcohol poisoning has been rising in recent years, and reached 14,250 in 2015, according to the state statistics service. Illegal surrogate products like the bath lotion account for about 20 percent of the market, and demand for them is growing very rapidly, according to RBC, a Russian news website. In addition to being cheaper than legitimate liquor, the surrogate products are also easier to get; in several Russian cities, they are sold in vending machines that operate around the clock, not just during legal hours for liquor sales. Aleksander Khloponin, the deputy prime minister responsible for alcohol policy, promised in an interview with the state-run Rossiya-24 television channel on Thursday that the products would be removed from all vending machines.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/world/after-72-die-putin-tightens-limits-on-consumer-products-high-in-alcohol.html"}
