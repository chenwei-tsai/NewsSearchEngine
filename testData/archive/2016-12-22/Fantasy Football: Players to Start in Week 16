Cam Newton (CAR vs. Falcons) \u2014 He has been a huge disappointment from a fantasy league perspective after his monster 2015 campaign, but he has a chance for redemption in what is a championship Week 16 for most season-long leagues. After a gutsy performance against the Redskins, in which he played through pain to throw for 300 yards and two touchdowns, Newton faces a defense that has allowed the second most passing yards and the most fantasy points to quarterbacks this season. Philip Rivers (SD at Browns) \u2014 He hasn\u2019t had an elite fantasy performance since Week 5, against the Raiders, but give him points for consistency, as he has had at least two touchdown passes in every game since Week 8. The Browns have allowed multiple touchdown passes to quarterbacks in 11 of 14 games and the second most fantasy points to the position. Sleeper: Derek Carr (OAK vs. Titans) Proceed With Caution: Aaron Rodgers (GB vs. Vikings) Jordan Howard (CHI vs. Redskins) \u2014 A top-five option at the position this week, Howard is averaging 17.6 fantasy points per game over the last four weeks and now gets a top-five fantasy matchup with the Redskins. Washington has allowed six running backs to top 10 fantasy points in its last five games, including performances of at least 24 points by David Johnson and Ezekiel Elliott. Latavius Murray (OAK vs. Colts) \u2014 He\u2019ll be looking to rebound from a letdown fantasy performance against the Chargers in Week 15, though he still averaged 6.2 yards per carry. Before last week, Murray had three consecutive games with at least 14 fantasy points. The Colts have allowed an opposing back to top at least 14 fantasy points in three of the last five weeks. They are allowing the ninth most fantasy points to the position this season. Doug Martin (TB at Saints) \u2014 It wasn\u2019t pretty, but Martin had at least 12 fantasy points in two of his last three games, including 14.5 against the Saints two weeks ago. New Orleans is tied for the third most rushing touchdowns to backs and has yielded the third most fantasy points to the position. Sleeper: Todd Gurley (LA vs. 49ers) Proceed With Caution: Rob Kelley (WAS at Bears) T.Y. Hilton (IND at Raiders) \u2014 Vegas is thinking this game could be an offensive field day, picking it as the highest scoring game of the week (53 total points). Hilton faced three of the N.F.L.\u2019s toughest pass defenses in the last four weeks but put up two 15-point performances, anyway. He also was rested in the fourth quarter of last week\u2019s blowout win against the Vikings. The Raiders\u2019 receiving defense is ranked 22nd this season. Michael Crabtree (OAK vs. Colts) \u2014 You will want to consider both Crabtree and Amari Cooper in this potentially high-scoring affair. Crabtree has been more consistent than his teammate, with at least 11 points in three of the last four games, but Cooper has shown greater potential for more elite performances. Crabtree is the safer bet, but consider Cooper if you need a large chunk of points. Tyrell Williams (SD at Browns) \u2014 He had been cruising since Week 9, with at least 11 fantasy points in four consecutive games before two straight duds. He is a great bet to bounce back against the Browns, who have given up the most passing touchdowns in the league (31) this season. Sleeper: Sterling Shepard (NYG at Eagles) Proceed With Caution: A.J. Green (CIN at Texans) Greg Olsen (CAR vs. Falcons) \u2014 He hasn\u2019t had a touchdown since Week 9 but has at least 85 receiving yards in each of the last two games. You know he\u2019ll be Cam Newton\u2019s target of choice in a favorable matchup with the Falcons. Sleeper: Jason Witten (DAL vs. Lions) Proceed With Caution: Tyler Eifert (CIN at Texans) Defense/Special Teams Start: BUF vs. Dolphins; SEA vs. Cardinals.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/sports/football/fantasy-football-players-to-start-in-week-16.html"}
