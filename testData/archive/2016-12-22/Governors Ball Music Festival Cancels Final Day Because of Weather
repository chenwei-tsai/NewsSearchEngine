In an email to ticket holders, the festival\u2019s organizers said that \u201cthe safety of fans, artists and crew always comes first,\u201d and that all performances for Sunday would be canceled because of \u201ca high likelihood of lightning\u201d around the stages at Randalls Island Park in New York. Mr. West was the headliner among nearly two dozen performances scheduled for the festival\u2019s third and final day. Fans expressed their disappointment on Twitter: Governors Ball typically has a \u201crain or shine\u201d policy. The festival has persisted in the past despite rain \u2014 most recently, Saturday. The Panorama festival, with a lineup including Arcade Fire, Kendrick Lamar and LCD Soundsystem, is scheduled to take place at the same location in July. Ticket holders were told they would receive refunds, and were directed to the festival\u2019s website for updates.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/06/arts/music/governors-ball-music-festival-cancels-final-day-because-of-weather.html"}
