The Drunken Angels Sing","body":" Thank you for all the flowers and kind notes when I was in the psych ward last week. Yes, the rumors were true: I did indeed try to cut off my ear when I heard \u201cFairytale of New York\u201d for the 27,056th time. But a strict regimen in which all holiday music was forbidden, as well as any Celtic folk song with pipes and drums, has returned me to my cheerful, well-adjusted self. I am now strong enough to tackle the question of how a 29-year-old tune by the Pogues about a melancholy alcoholic and his junkie girlfriend, which has been named the most played holiday song of the 21st century in the United Kingdom, is threatening to become New York City\u2019s holiday anthem, plaguing us into the new year. So let me just take a few tablets of Clonazepam and we can begin. How did \u201cFairytale of New York,\u201d in which two Irish lovers in New York exchange such endearments as \u201cbum,\u201d \u201cslut,\u201d \u201cpunk\u201d and \u201cmaggot,\u201d get to be so popular? There are those who feel that the song addresses the \u201cRudolph Paradigm\u201d; that is to say the need to balance the season\u2019s saccharine, oftentimes nauseating standards with something truly bleak. I could go a step further, arguing that the dark genius of \u201cFairytale\u201d is that it speaks not merely to one\u2019s need to be miserable on a holiday, but to the need to be more miserable than anyone else. The song invites a delicious, almost luxuriant self-pity and melancholy that envelops you like a steaming tub filled with expensive bath oils. Not that I would know, of course. This is just what people tell me. Songwriters often speak of the importance of the first few lines of a song, which determine whether you will keep listening or will tune to a different channel. What? Are you saying we can turn it off? Can you address the song\u2019s powerful first lines: \u201cIt was Christmas Eve babe in the drunk tank/ an old man said to me, won\u2019t see another one.\u201d As with any great work of art, \u201cFairytale\u201d speaks to a universal experience. Who among us has not suffered the indignity of being in a drunk tank, the smells of stale urine and vomit, the absence of small talk? Only last week I was in my Too Darn Hot yoga class and the instructor was late because she had been detained in the drunk tank again. Once when she was in the tank, they had confiscated her mat, and when she got out she had to walk through the Village without one. Can you imagine, a woman in Greenwich Village not carrying a yoga mat? She felt so conspicuous she had to stop at a bar and throw back a few shots, which of course started the whole cycle. I was struck by the word \u201cbabe\u201d in the first line of \u201cFairytale of New York.\u201d Despite being an alcoholic, or at least having gotten so soused he has ended up in a drunk tank, the male narrator still has a romantic partner. Of course he does \u2014 he\u2019s a guy. Men can be on death row and have romantic partners, and if they don\u2019t, my friend Sybil Adelman will be fixing them up. On the other hand, if you\u2019re a single woman over 50, with a degree from N.Y.U. and an apartment that is completely paid off, good luck even getting a reply on JDate\u2026 Sorry, where was I? The part of \u201cFairytale of New York\u201d I can never get out of my head is the chorus about how the boys of the N.Y.P.D. choir were singing \u201cGalway Bay.\u201d It\u2019s so authentically New York City. The N.Y.P.D. doesn\u2019t have a choir. The Pogues did get the guys from the Police Department\u2019s Emerald Society, the pipes and drums outfit, to show up for the video, but according to a story in The Guardian, they didn\u2019t know the words to \u201cGalway Bay\u201d and had to sing the song from the Mickey Mouse Club. So what, who doesn\u2019t love the Emerald Society? And who hasn\u2019t had a boozy, charming boyfriend like the guy in the song who gets loaded and nasty and then tells you he can\u2019t live without you? Oh, my God, you too? We should have coffee some time and talk. Or better yet, a drink. I know a great bar that is always playing this old Pogues song this time of year. It makes me feel so deliciously melancholy.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/nyregion/hark-the-drunken-angels-sing.html"}
