It documents how the burden of a criminal record is imposed disproportionately and unfairly on minorities of limited means, frequently through unreviewable decisions of prosecutors, effectively re-creating the peonage that replaced slavery immediately after the Civil War. With a criminal record comes a vast network of restrictions and biases that operate to consign a third of the adult population to permanent second-class citizenship, as punitive as the old civil death laws that stripped a convicted person of all rights and privileges, and far more wide-reaching. It is a sad day for this country when only those with the means get a second chance. Until we can find a way to enforce the law in an evenhanded fashion, and temper justice with mercy for all, America will inevitably fall short of its promised greatness.

Bush and Bill Clinton, represents applicants for executive clemency.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/opinion/justice-if-you-can-afford-it.html"}
