Their works can be seen at the New-York Historical Society.","title":"Muhammad Ali: Drawn, Painted and Photographed","body":" Muhammad Ali\u2019s death in June was a reminder of what a brilliant muse he was, especially to photographers. He told us he was pretty, and he was right. But he was more than that. As images from his half-century of renown revealed anew, he had created an astonishing canvas simply by smiling, or by flicking a jab, preaching at a mosque, hitting the speed bag, glistening with sweat, rejecting entry into the military, goofing with the Beatles, screaming in mock-lunacy at Sonny Liston, taunting Joe Frazier and rope-a-doping with George Foreman. He rarely seemed to be offstage \u2014 or to take a bad picture. Ali\u2019s attractiveness as an artistic subject is being explored in a pair of animated exhibitions at the New-York Historical Society: the Ali photographs by George Kalinsky, the official photographer of Madison Square Garden, and the watercolors and sketches of Ali by the idiosyncratic artist LeRoy Neiman. While the works by Mr. Kalinsky and Mr. Neiman examine similar times in Ali\u2019s life, they are vastly different. The images in \u201c\u2018I Am King of the World\u2019: Photographs of Muhammad Ali by George Kalinsky\u201d are all in black and white. Mr. Neiman\u2019s Impressionistic paintings in \u201cMuhammad Ali, LeRoy Neiman, and the Art of Boxing\u201d are brilliantly colored, some dashed off quickly, as if he were trying to catch up to the immediacy of a photograph, or a punch. Marilyn Satin Kushner, curator of the Kalinsky photos, said: \u201cA photograph is a moment in time and a watercolor is fluid and can depict action better than a photograph. So where LeRoy Neiman was able to capture the motion, I think George was able to capture the emotion and get to Ali\u2019s soul.\u201d These two artists were close friends for about 50 years, but were as different as their artistry: Mr. Kalinsky is low-key and soft-spoken. Mr. Neiman, who died in 2012, was a boldface personality and self-made celebrity who painted and sketched on live television. And he often tried to encourage Mr. Kalinsky to be a bit flamboyant. \u201cHe said: \u2018Look at me; you know immediately who I am. I have the mustache, the cigar; I\u2019ve got my pad already ready to sketch, and the girl on my arm,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kalinsky said, recalling his pitch. \u201cHe\u2019d said: \u2018You need props. You should have a white camera and dress only in white \u2014 white jacket, pants and hat.\u2019 \u201cI said: \u2018LeRoy, you\u2019re built one way, I\u2019m built another. You have incredible charisma. You have to have props. But I\u2019m not built that way.\u2019\u201d Mr. Neiman created the invitations to Mr. Kalinsky\u2019s wedding in 1998, and sketched as he and his bride, June Azoulay, walked down the aisle. Mr. Neiman wore white. Their careers were rooted, in part, by their fascination with Ali and boxing. Mr. Neiman met the fighter first, in 1962, in the dressing room of St. Nicholas Arena in Manhattan, where the brash 20-year-old was about to fight Billy Daniels. Mr. Neiman was sketching Ali, contemplative, with his hands taped and about to have his gloves fitted. The curious boxer grabbed the sketchbook. \u201cI can do that,\u201d he told Mr. Neiman. \u201cGimme that thing.\u201d And he drew a small picture of himself, as well as a jet and a sleek car with tail fins and signed it: \u201cBy the Great Cassius Clay. Next Champ. By 1963.\u201d They met again in 1964 before Clay \u2014 soon to announce his conversion to Islam and his name change to Muhammad Ali \u2014 was to fight for the heavyweight title against Liston. Sitting together, Mr. Neiman helped Ali create a victory sketch \u2014 albeit a crude one \u2014 that depicted him knocking out Liston and declaring: \u201cI told you I was great. I stoped [sic] Liston in eight.\u201d Ali won when Liston failed to answer the bell for the seventh round. Some of Mr. Neiman\u2019s works in the exhibition include notes that suggest he saw his paintings as semi-journalistic chronicles. In one, Mr. Neiman apparently jotted down what Malcolm X was saying to Ali: \u201cAllah has given you the strength to beat Liston. You can show the world what a true believer can do. You can win. You can do this. You are going to be the greatest of all time.\u201d Tara Zabor, director of operations at the LeRoy Neiman Foundation, said: \u201cHe recorded everything that happened around him. He treated his sketchbooks as a kind of journal. He wrote what was happening so he could tell the story.\u201d Mr. Kalinsky began photographing Ali in 1965, the year after he captured the heavyweight title from Liston. More than 40 of Mr. Kalinsky\u2019s pictures are in the show \u2014 shots of Ali in the ring, in training, driving a busload of reporters, sleeping, clowning and completing the pictures in a military coloring book the year he refused induction. \u201cThe very first foot of film I ever took as a professional was of him working out in Miami in 1965,\u201d said Mr. Kalinsky, who parlayed pictures from that training session into his job at the Garden. \u201cMany times we had a conversation without talking. He\u2019d look in my eyes and I always got the feeling that he trusted me.\u201d One day in 1976, Mr. Kalinsky and Mr. Neiman were in the back of a station wagon in the Catskills at 4 a.m. as Ali ran behind them, training for his third fight against Ken Norton. Mr. Neiman was sketching and Mr. Kalinsky shooting. \u201cAli took a shower and was in bed,\u201d Mr. Kalinsky said, \u201cand I asked him: \u2018Why are you fighting? You\u2019re going to really hurt yourself.\u2019 And he said: \u2018I can\u2019t stop. The ring is my stage and I\u2019m probably the most famous face that there is. If I stop fighting, people will forget who I am.\u2019\u201d","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/arts/design/muhammad-ali-drawn-painted-and-photographed.html"}
