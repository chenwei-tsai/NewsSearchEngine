Global commemorative events throughout the year have included major retrospectives in the artist\u2019s hometown, \u2019s-Hertogenbosch, in the Netherlands, and at the Prado in Madrid. In the run-up to the year, scholars raced to complete new examinations of Bosch\u2019s artworks all over the world and to advance new theories about his life and art, and the result is a profusion of hefty Bosch tomes, which range from authoritative technical analyses to a novelist\u2019s art travelogue. The landmark achievement of these efforts is a comprehensive catalog raisonn√©, produced by the Bosch Research and Conservation Project in \u2019s-Hertogenbosch, through an exhaustive examination by a group of art historians and scientists who traveled the world to examine and document every single work attributed to the artist. The 600-page illustrated catalog is accompanied by a 460-page volume of technical studies of the paintings (but not the drawings), made using infrared photography, infrared reflectography and X-radiography. Hewing to academic methodology, the monograph makes for rather dry reading, but it contains revelations that have led to controversial new attributions, irking some in the museum world and pleasing others. (The Prado took exception to the downgrading of two of its works formerly attributed to Bosch, while a Kansas City, Mo., museum was thrilled to learn it had a genuine Bosch.) The wealth of new data and ideas will no doubt keep scholars busy for decades. For the lay reader, the more exciting element is the edition of technical studies, which reproduces the paintings alongside images of the layers beneath (shot with infrared and other technologies), providing a thrilling opportunity to climb inside each Bosch painting, to see the draftsman\u2019s hand at work as he creates his underdrawings, to witness how he changes his mind and erases or adds imagery, then builds up his canvas layer by layer. In addition to these two weighty books, Matthijs Ilsink and Jos Koldeweij, the leaders of the Bosch project and curators of the Noordbrabants Museum exhibition \u201cHieronymus Bosch: Visions of Genius\u201d (which closed in May), have also authored a show catalog of the same name, which is much easier to carry and lushly illustrated with descriptions of the works in accessible \u2014 if a bit lackluster \u2014 reader-friendly prose. In the less visually alluring but more contextually illuminating \u201cJheronimus Bosch: The Road to Heaven and Hell,\u201d the art historian and author Gary Schwartz explores Bosch\u2019s links to the institutions of his hometown \u2014 including a particularly fascinating look at the secret society the Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Dear Lady, in which Bosch was a sworn brother, cleric and possible exorcist \u2014 and to the larger religious, literary, institutional and artistic touchstones that charged his wildly creative imagination. \u201cIf the work of Bosch is an island, it is like the water-surrounded town of Den Bosch itself,\u201d Schwartz writes, using the shortened name of \u2019s-Hertogenbosch, \u201cconnected by bridges, roads and sea routes to more than one mainland.\u201d Departing from the realm of scholarship and art historical debate, the Dutch novelist Cees Nooteboom, invited to appear in a documentary to be broadcast in Bosch Year, uses the occasion to take a personal tour of Bosch paintings in various European museums. He is granted exceptional access to \u201cThe Garden of Earthly Delights\u201d at the Prado, and follows up with trips to the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam and the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, among other locations of Bosch masterpieces. The resulting slim volume of meandering, loosely philosophical observations is really an extended essay with five postscripts printed in a large font, illustrated with details of key paintings, in which he puzzles over Bosch\u2019s imagery, in awe of the sheer originality and complexity. \u201cNow that I am standing close to them, the abundance of details assaults me,\u201d he writes. \u201cI would need a year merely to see everything, let alone to penetrate within.\u201d Nooteboom maintains this awkward remove from the artworks throughout, and the book ends, after much traveling, viewing and musing, in a note of conciliatory defeat. He writes: \u201cWith a variation on a famous Dutch line of poetry, you might say, \u2018Just look, you do not see what you see.\u2019 And that is exactly what I saw in Lisbon, Madrid, Ghent and now here: all that I saw, and yet perhaps not.\u201d The Harvard professor Joseph Leo Koerner offers a more gratifying exegesis in his eloquent and rich exploration, \u201cBosch and Bruegel,\u201d in which he compares Bosch to his Netherlandish successor Pieter Bruegel the Elder, writing that they both \u201ccaptivate and overload our sense of sight, entangling the eye in anomalous objects, actors and activities, and ensnaring the mind\u2019s eye in enigmas and seeming secrets that arouse but never satisfy interpretive curiosity.\u201d Based on Koerner\u2019s A.W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the series of talks seamlessly form a book of linked essays that discuss individual paintings with magnifying precision, while simultaneously advancing a broader theory on art in a Europe emerging from its dark ages. Koerner proposes that Bosch created what he calls \u201cenemy painting\u201d and \u201cteaches contempt for the world by showing the rest of humanity sinfully enthralled by the world and at the brink of judgment and damnation.\u201d Bosch\u2019s didacticism, he observes, evolves with Bruegel, who later in the 16th century presents a vision in which devilish characters roam free, but \u201cno one is against man except man himself.\u201d These observations bring Bosch\u2019s work into relevance today, beyond the obvious promotions of the Bosch Year, and we begin to grasp why those little hybrid demons still feel so contemporary to us 500 years after they were created.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/books/review/books-about-hieronymus-bosch.html"}
