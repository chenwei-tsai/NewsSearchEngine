The show\u2019s producers announced that the Grammy Award-winning singer Rhiannon Giddens will make her Broadway debut as Ms. McDonald\u2019s replacement. Savion Glover, the show\u2019s Tony-nominated choreographer, will also join the cast in a capacity still to be determined by the director, George C. Wolfe, according to a spokesman for the show. Ms. McDonald\u2019s pregnancy means that she will postpone her West End debut in a reprisal of her Tony-winning role in \u201cLady Day at Emerson\u2019s Bar and Grill,\u201d which was set to begin performances in June. (Her three-month hiatus from \u201cShuffle Along\u201d to perform in London was announced before \u201cShuffle Along\u201d opened.) Her return date to the show, a jazz-and-tap-heavy show about a 1921 all-black Broadway musical, was not announced, although a news release said she would be back \u201cthis winter.\u201d This will be Ms. McDonald\u2019s first child with her husband, the actor Will Swenson, although they have three children from previous marriages. In a statement Ms. McDonald said she was disappointed to postpone \u201cLady Day\u201d and temporarily leave \u201cShuffle Along,\u201d but was looking forward \u201cto setting up a 1920s-themed nursery in my dressing room when I return to the show.\u201d Ms. Giddens, a singer and musician, will make her Broadway debut. She is best known as the leader of the Carolina Chocolate Drops, a band that aims to preserve the tradition of African-American string bands of the early 20th century, roughly the era depicted in \u201cShuffle Along.\u201d Her solo album, \u201cTomorrow Is My Turn,\u201d was released in February. In a review in The New York Times earlier this year, Stephen Holden said that Ms. Giddens possessed a \u201cbeautiful voice and air of supernal calm.\u201d \u201cShuffle Along\u201d was nominated for 10 Tony Awards last week, including best musical. Ms. McDonald, who has a record six Tony Awards, did not receive a nomination.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/theater/rhiannon-giddens-to-replace-audra-mcdonald-during-shuffle-along-hiatus.html"}
