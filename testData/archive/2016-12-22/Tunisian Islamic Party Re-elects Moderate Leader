The leader, Rachid Ghannouchi, a renowned Islamic thinker who spent 22 years in exile during Tunisia\u2019s dictatorship, had tears in his eyes Monday as he embraced his rival in the party vote, which he won with 800 of the 1,058 ballots cast. The vote, a culmination of a three-day party congress here in Tunis, was a victory for Mr. Ghannouchi, 74, and an important turning point for his party, Ennahda, as it seeks to separate the party\u2019s religious and political activities. \u201cOne of the most important changes we came to was the independence of the political mission and the political party from social and cultural activities,\u201d Mr. Ghannouchi told reporters. \u201cWe were not able to achieve this cause before because of a lack of clarity.\u201d He said the party had matured and the country\u2019s new Constitution \u2014 guaranteeing freedom of religion, and calling for a separation of politics from civil society \u2014 had made a change in the party\u2019s direction possible. \u201cThe Ennahda millstone works slowly,\u201d he said in Arabic. \u201cIt makes the cereals smooth, very smooth, after it grinds the corn.\u201d Inspired by Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood, the party was founded as the Islamic Tendency Movement in 1981, and later renamed Ennahda, or Renaissance. Thousands of its members were imprisoned or exiled under Tunisia\u2019s authoritarian presidents, Habib Bourguiba and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. Mr. Ghannouchi returned to Tunisia from Britain in the weeks after the popular uprising that ousted Mr. Ben Ali in 2011 and led Ennahda to victory in 2012 in Tunisia\u2019s first democratic elections. After that victory, the party struggled to govern Tunisia in the tumultuous period following the revolution as secular opposition to the Islamists grew. They were seen by some to condone a surge of Salafist vigilantism in Tunisia, and popular confidence in the party\u2019s leadership waned amid economic difficulties and rising terrorism. Mr. Ghannouchi reached an agreement in 2013 with the leading secularist politician, Beji Caid Essebsi, for Ennahda to cede power to a caretaker government before new elections. The agreement helped usher in a new Constitution. Though Ennahda was beaten in elections in 2014 by Mr. Essebsi\u2019s party, Nidaa Tounes, Mr. Ghannouchi was widely credited with having secured his party a permanent position in Tunisian politics. Mr. Essebsi went on to win the presidency in December 2014, and he has remained a close ally of Mr. Ghannouchi, who has never held any public office. The president attended the opening rally of Ennahda\u2019s party congress in Tunis, standing beside Mr. Ghannouchi and urging thousands of Ennahda supporters to participate in building a sovereign modern society. \u201cIslam is never in contradiction with democracy,\u201d he said to widespread applause. Ennahda remains a critical element in the political stability of the country, and has emerged once again with the most seats in Parliament after a breakup this year of the secular Nidaa Tounes party. Mr. Ghannouchi has repeatedly called on his followers to put national stability and security ahead of party interests, but now Ennahda is evidently looking ahead to municipal elections scheduled for May 2017. Party members overwhelmingly expressed their support for the motion to separate political affairs of the party from religious and cultural activities, albeit with the understanding that Islam remains the party\u2019s ideological foundation. \u201cBefore we were afraid for our identity,\u201d Mohammad Krad, a party member from the island of Djerba, said as he left the rally last Friday. \u201cNow we have a Constitution that says we are Arab and Muslim, so we do not need restate it in our politics.\u201d More than 1,000 representatives gathered Saturday for two days of vigorous debate at the congress in the beach resort town of Hammamet. The decision to separate Ennahda\u2019s religious, cultural and social mission from the party\u2019s political activities had been in the works for a year and a half, and passed with more than 80 percent of the party vote, said Rafik Abdessalem, Ennahda\u2019s head of external relations and Mr. Ghannouchi\u2019s son-in-law. The topic of greatest debate \u2014 and the closest vote \u2014 was over whether the party\u2019s executive council should be elected by the congress or appointed by Mr. Ghannouchi and confirmed by the congress. Mr. Ghannouchi eventually won that vote, too.","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/world/africa/tunisia-rachid-ghannouchi-ennahda.html"}
