What began as a passing thought in the mind of Thomas Tull, chief executive of Legendary Entertainment, has now reached the big screen here. Legendary\u2019s \u201cThe Great Wall,\u201d directed by Zhang Yimou and starring Matt Damon, was released in China last Friday. With a budget of more than $150 million, the fantastical film about fighting monsters on the Great Wall is the largest-ever China-Hollywood coproduction and is being seen as a test of whether event films made in China can become hits in the West. (It is scheduled to hit cinemas in North America on Feb. 17.) Set in ancient China, the film centers on William Garin (Mr. Damon), a foreign mercenary who is taken captive by a secret army of elite fighters on the Great Wall called the Nameless Order. Garin and his sidekick (played by Pedro Pascal) soon learn that the wall was built to protect against mythical flesh-eating monsters called the taotie, who rise up every 60 years to devour humanity. Reviews of the movie in China have so far been mixed. On Douban, a popular book and movie review website, the movie has an average rating of 5.4 stars out of 10 based on more than 82,000 ratings. Many of the reviewers \u2014 both professional and amateur \u2014 have expressed disappointment with Mr. Zhang, lamenting his turn from art house hits like \u201cRaise the Red Lantern\u201d to blatantly commercial, popcorn movies. One amateur critic, Xiedu Film, set off a dust-up when he wrote on the Sina Weibo microblog, \u201cZhang Yimou has died!\u201d Le Vision Pictures, one of the production companies backing the movie, on Friday demanded that the critic apologize and delete the comment, which the company called a serious violation of Mr. Zhang\u2019s right to reputation. \u201cIt\u2019s akin to libel and cursing,\u201d the company wrote on Sina Weibo. Xiedu Film explained in a follow-up message: \u201cI just feel that Zhang\u2019s art career is almost coming to an end.\u201d Still, other reviewers applauded the film for its dazzling effects and expressed excitement about the film\u2019s potential to export Chinese culture to the rest of the world. We rounded up reactions from Chinese filmgoers and critics writing for Chinese and Western outlets. Here are excerpts (including in some cases translated passages) from reviews from the upbeat to the negative. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of reviews that say \u2018The Great Wall\u2019 has a thin plot. This is indeed a shortcoming. But if the movie turns out to be an international box office success, then [the plot] will also be seen as having contributed to that. For foreigners unfamiliar with Chinese stories, a complicated story would have made them confused and disoriented.\u201d \u2014 Raymond Zhou, movie critic, in Tencent\u2019s Dajia Column \u201cDespite his best efforts [to suppress his signature style], there are still traces of Zhang Yimou in the movie. The scenes with the synchronized drummers recall the opening ceremonies of the Olympics, and the dense forest of arrows and the spear movements of the bungee-jumping female fighters are like those seen in Peking Opera. There\u2019s no way to erase this. And, even though he did not use very much red, there were still hints everywhere of his passion for vivid colors.\u201d \u2014 Yang Shiyang, movie critic, in Tencent\u2019s Dajia Column \u201cMost big Hollywood films are very simple, direct and universal in the system of values they embody. Freedom, honor, fairness, justice, love and the spirit of dying for a just cause \u2014 these are the most common values that they convey. But in \u2018The Great Wall,\u2019 why are these soldiers fighting, dying and sacrificing their bodies? What spirit did they represent that they could persuade Garin, the \u2018foreign bandit\u2019 to stay behind? None of this is fully explained in the movie.\u201d \u2014 Yin Hong, film professor at Tsinghua University, on the Sina Weibo microblog The similarity of the premise to past films \u201cwouldn\u2019t be such a problem if Zhang or his scribes had devoted even a smidgen of time to giving the respective commanders identities or back stories. Instead, though they are played by recognized actors with proven ability and charisma, these characters are just glorified cameos, stomping around in heavy armor looking angry or worried or both.\u201d \u2014 Maggie Lee, Variety \u201cBeyond the casting and the ceaseless onslaught of diverse special effects, Zhang and his Hollywood screenwriters have delivered nothing more than a formulaic monster movie \u2014 albeit one transposed to a historically undefined China where generals dressed like terra-cotta warriors already have mastered anesthetics, air travel and American-accented English.\u201d \u2014 Clarence Tsui, Hollywood Reporter \u201cEvery predictable turn comes to pass, and most major developments loom so large it\u2019s a wonder the elite fighters don\u2019t spot them. Aside from the nods to Chinese culture, there is little to differentiate between this and any other Hollywood action adventure.\u201d \u2014 Helen Roxburgh, The Guardian \u201cWhen all is said and done, it\u2019s just 94 minutes of content which forces the plot to move too quickly. We don\u2019t see nearly enough about the deployment of the army. There is not enough context about the roles that the villains and the supporting figures play. Not to mention the female soldiers all have very fair and clear skin. I don\u2019t think people who fight in real wars can have skin that tender. And that guy, what\u2019s his name, Junkai [who plays the teenage emperor], he is the epitome of what we call \u2018good looking until you open your mouth.\u2019\u201d \u2014 Miaoke Zhongguo, online user, on Douban \u2014 Max Horowits, user, on Zhihu.com (the Chinese equivalent of Quora)","url":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/movies/the-great-wall-what-critics-and-filmgoers-are-saying-in-china.html"}
